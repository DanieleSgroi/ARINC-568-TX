# ARINC 568 TX
Arduino based ARINC 568 (or 561) Transmitter

# DESCRIPTION
This sketch demonstrates transmission of ARINC 568 (or ARINC 561) Distance Measurement Equipment (DME) slant-range data with an Arduino Pro Mini clocked at 16 MHz.

The digital outputs shall be connected to proper level shifters in order to achieve the necessary electrical-level compatibility to the standard (0-12 V Output).

It has been succesfully used to emulate ARINC 568 data output of Rockwell-Collins DME-40/42 in order to troubleshoot A/C system integration.

This sketch can be used as skeleton for more complex data simulations.
